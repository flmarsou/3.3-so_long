# ü¶ä What is So Long?

WIP

# ‚öíÔ∏è Compilation

1. Run `make` to compile the program.
2. Run `make re` to recompile everything.
3. Run `./so_long <map_path>` to execute the program.

Maps can be found in the [`maps`](https://github.com/flmarsou/3.3-so_long/tree/main/maps) folder, and has to be in the `.ber` extension.
- `1`: Wall
- `0`: Floor
- `P`: Player
- `C`: Collectible
- `E`: Exit

Only the <ins>**specified characters**</ins> (e.g., walls, floors, etc.). \
Maps must be <ins>**rectangular**</ins> and <ins>**enclosed**</ins> (player cannot move outside the map area). \
Maps must contain exactly <ins>**one player**</ins> and <ins>**one exit**</ins>. \
It must be <ins>**possible to reach all collectible(s)**</ins> and <ins>**the exit**</ins> from the starting position.

# üßº Cleaning

1. Run `make clean` to remove every object files.
2. Run `make fclean` to remove every object files, including the executable.

# üìë List of Functions

## 1. Map
- [x] [`init_map`](https://github.com/flmarsou/3.3-so_long/blob/main/src/map/init_map.c) - Stores each line of the .ber file into an allocated array.
- [x] [`read_map`](https://github.com/flmarsou/3.3-so_long/blob/main/src/map/read_map.c) - Slightly modified version of [get_next_line](https://github.com/flmarsou/2.2-get_next_line).
- [x] [`parse_map`](https://github.com/flmarsou/3.3-so_long/blob/main/src/map/parse_map.c) - Checks for characters, size, and duplicates.
